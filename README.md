Better Code Review
==================

Makes it enjoyable for lazy engineers to review sophisticated code.

## Demo and homepage

[http://bettercodereview.org](http://bettercodereview.org)

## Engineering methodology

To develop Better Code Review I am using a novel engineering methodology. If you are interested in collaborating, please review this methodology [here](http://bettercodereview.org/#0#3#main:Top#development-method:engineering%20methodology).


## Feature requests

1. Modify the pyalgebra demo so that hyperlinks are underlined on hover
2. Implement Better Code Review

## Regarding feature request #2

I think it can be done fairly straight forwardly by developing several components:

1. The better-code-review compiler will read in a source code project, and produce a Sidenote project as output
2. A better-code-review.js will be a Sidenote plugin. It will probably depend on sidenote.js). It will add all the features to Sidenote that are necessary to create the better-code-review reviewer experience.
